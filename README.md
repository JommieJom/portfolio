### Recipe Generation with Seq2Seq and Attention – NLP
Developed and evaluated neural models for recipe generation using PyTorch on the Kiddon et al. cooking dataset. Implemented Seq2Seq baselines with attention and extended them using additive attention, GloVe embeddings, copy mechanisms, and set-based encoders. Achieved over 100% improvement in BLEU-4 score on most extended models. Conducted both quantitative (BLEU-4, METEOR, BERTScore) and qualitative evaluation under resource constraints.

### Machine Learning and Model Selection
Implemented KNN regression, L-fold cross-validation, and Ridge Regression from scratch. Investigated regularization and model complexity using synthetic and real datasets. Compared logistic regression and Bayesian classifiers through learning curve analysis.

### Unsupervised Learning and Neural Representations
Performed document clustering using EM, visualized PCA clusters, and compared hard vs soft assignments. Built and evaluated autoencoders and self-taught neural networks for feature augmentation and improved classification.

### Deep Neural Network Architectures
